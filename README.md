# Food UI Landing-Page,

A test project created for an educational course for an MMI project. The goal was to review the basics of Vue.Js 2 and learn how to use Vue.Js3 compositions, use GIT and its commands to develop the project and learn how to use Storybook to create a component library. After that, we created a small API to store the data needed for this project and used it to develop components that use the API's data.
